I will update these as the term goes on. 

If you're running any Linux distribution based on Debian (such as Ubuntu or Mint) run the python-fix.sh file:

```
sudo bash python-fix.sh
```

Sun the scripts from your Python compiler, if you're on Linux I recommend:

```
sudo ptyhon3 week2.py
```
For example.
